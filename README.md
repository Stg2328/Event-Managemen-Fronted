## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (>=12.x)
- Vue CLI (`npm install -g @vue/cli`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd event-management
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following configuration:

   ```env
   VUE_APP_API_URL=<your_backend_api_url>
   ```

   Replace `<your_backend_api_url>` with the backend API URL for the event management system.

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Development

- **Main Entry Point**  
  `main.js` is the entry point where the Vue instance is initialized.

- **Routing**  
  Routing is handled via `Vue Router`, with routes defined in `routes.js`.

- **State Management**  
  Vuex is used for managing the global state, with the store configuration in `store.js`.

- **Components**  
  All Vue components, such as `Login.vue`, `SignUp.vue`, and `Header.vue`, are located in the `components/` folder.

### Build for Production

To build the app for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the production-ready files in the `dist/` directory, which can be deployed to a web server.
